<Description>The projects and their creators who made quadratic/ui possible.</Description>

Obviously, huge credit to [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn), who built [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). He did an amazing job with shadcn/ui's components and documentation.

Next, credit to the [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) team who maintains [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/). Radix UI provides a lot of the components on which shadcn/ui is built on.

Additionally, a lot of quadratic/ui's documentation is copy and pasted directly from Radix UI or shadcn/ui documentation.

Finally, quadratic/ui also depends on a bunch of other open source packages, which are listed below. Please let me know if I missed any!
