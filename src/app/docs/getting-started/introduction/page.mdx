<Title>Introduction</Title>
<Description>About quadratic/ui.</Description>

Ever since I discovered [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), I've used it in every single one of my projects. It's beautiful and I love how component code lives in my repository.

That said, I did find myself making the same little tweaks to shadcn/ui's components in every project I started. Thus, I decided to create a repository to store all these components. Eventually, I decided to build a docmentation site around my components.

This lead to the creation of quadratic/ui. It is basically a slightly modified version of shadcn/ui, complete with a [1:1 Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1351315753275186770/quadratic-ui-shadcn-ui-design-system-component-library), which now has almost 400 users!

Hopefully you'll find quadratic/ui as useful as I do. If you have any questions, or feel like something could be improved, please feel free to file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/qiaoandrew/quadratic-ui/issues).

Also, if you'd like to get in touch, send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewqiao/) or [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewwqiao).

All the best!

Andrew
